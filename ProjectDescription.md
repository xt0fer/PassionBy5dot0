### I can help you plan your shopping when and where

A Web Application front end developed in Angular, 

* Should be able to configure the things to buy from different Shops.
* Show the List that needs to be bought from each shop
* Should be able to configure the Shops and items that we normally buy. Should be able to add / delete.

A spring Boot app to get and service the request from the Angular App.

* Save the Data to DB (postgress / MySQl)
* Send Email / Update Google callender on Weekly basis and reminders with notes.
* Reading Shopping list from Google notes updated by googleHome and update the DB on user login
