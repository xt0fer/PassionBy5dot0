## EduWaiter

EduWaiter is a restaurant waitstaff training application. 

This computer application generates customized study aids, games, and quizzes to help new servers maximize their restaurant and menu knowledge.

EduWaiter allows restaurant owners to:
* input menu items with images and detailed descriptions of ingredients, quantities, prices, allergens, and potential upsells
* easily create custom, interactive restaurant floor maps
* provide new employees with important restaurant information and answers to frequently asked questions
* keep staff updated with daily specials, drink selections, and new menu items
* track the progress of staff and trainees to ensure that their servers are ready to take the floor

Rapid server turnover due to insufficient training is a prominent source of waste in the restaurant industry.  EduWaiter's 
easily accessible, interactive learning tools improve the waitstaff training proces and contribute to the ongoing success of 
restaurant owners and staff alike.
